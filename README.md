# Point Cloud Visualizer

A simple and efficient helper tool for visualizing 3D reconstructed point clouds using Open3D. This repository provides an easy way to load and visualize PLY point cloud files generated by my 3D reconstruction engine. The PLY files can be found in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1j9wCUoUaDWJIetD_7Q1-zMzLfSv2ytGW?usp=sharing)

## Features

- Load and visualize PLY point cloud files
- Interactive 3D visualization with zoom, pan, and rotation controls
- Print point cloud statistics and point coordinates
- Simple, straightforward interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Open3D library
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd point_cloud_visualizer
```

2. Install the required dependencies using one of the following methods:

### Option 1: Using Conda (Recommended)

Create a conda environment from the provided `environment.yml` file:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pcd
```

Alternatively, you can manually install the dependencies:
```bash
conda install -c open3d-admin open3d
conda install numpy
```

### Option 2: Using pip

```bash
pip install open3d numpy
```

## Usage

1. Place your PLY point cloud file in the `data/` directory, or update the file path in the script.

2. Edit `point_cloud_visualizer.py` and modify the `point_cloud_path` variable to point to your PLY file:
```python
point_cloud_path = "data/your_point_cloud.ply"  # Change this to your file path
```

3. Run the visualization script:
```bash
python point_cloud_visualizer.py
```

4. The visualization window will open, displaying your point cloud. You can:
   - **Rotate**: Click and drag with the left mouse button
   - **Pan**: Click and drag with the middle mouse button (or Shift + left mouse button)
   - **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel or right-click and drag up/down
   - **Close**: Press 'Q' or close the window

## Example

The repository includes a sample point cloud file (`data/sample_office_scene.ply`) that you can use to test the visualizer.

## Supported File Formats

Currently, the script supports PLY format. Open3D also supports other formats like:
- PLY
- PCD
- XYZ
- XYZN
- XYZRGB
- PTX
- PTS

To use other formats, simply change the file extension in the `point_cloud_path` variable.

## Customization

You can customize the visualization by modifying the `draw_geometries` function parameters:

```python
o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([pcd],
                                  zoom=0.3412,
                                  front=[0.4257, -0.2125, -0.8795],
                                  lookat=[2.6172, 2.0475, 1.532],
                                  up=[-0.0694, -0.9768, 0.2024])
```
